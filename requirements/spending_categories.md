Got it 🚀 — you want a universal spending category set that makes sense globally, covers everything normal people spend on, and avoids overlap. Think of this as the “master categories” that every user will recognize, but still flexible for subcategories (like Starbucks under Food & Drink).

Here’s the ultimate category list (based on real-world finance apps + banking systems + human psychology):

💸 Core Spending Categories
🏠 Essentials

Housing → Rent, Mortgage, Utilities (electricity, water, internet, phone).

Groceries → Supermarket, fresh market, daily essentials.

Transportation → Fuel, public transit, taxi/Grab/Uber, car maintenance.

Bills & Services → Insurance, mobile plan, recurring household bills.

🍜 Lifestyle

Food & Drink (Dining Out) → Restaurants, cafes, delivery.

Shopping → Clothing, gadgets, beauty, home decor.

Entertainment & Leisure → Movies, games, streaming, concerts, hobbies.

Travel → Flights, hotels, tours, visas.

Health & Fitness → Gym, sports, supplements, wellness.

💼 Obligations

Education → Tuition, books, courses, subscriptions (like Skillshare, Udemy).

Family & Children → Kids’ expenses, daycare, school.

Pets → Food, vet, accessories.

Debt & Loans → Credit card payments, student loans, personal loans.

🎉 Extras

Gifts & Donations → Presents, charity, religious giving.

Events & Celebrations → Weddings, birthdays, festivals.

Subscriptions & Memberships → Netflix, Spotify, apps, clubs.

💳 Financial Flow

Savings & Investments → Deposits, stocks, crypto, retirement fund.

Miscellaneous/Other → Anything uncategorized (temporary bucket).

🌍 Why this works

Covers all human life spending without over-complicating.

Can expand with subcategories (example: “Food & Drink → Coffee Shops / Restaurants / Delivery”).

Separates Essentials vs Lifestyle vs Obligations, which makes AI insights sharper (like, “You spend 65% on Lifestyle, higher than peers”).

Clean, simple, universal → works for students, families, professionals, entrepreneurs.
