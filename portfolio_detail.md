Alright 🔥 — now we’re drilling down into the Portfolio Detail.
This is the screen where the user clicks a stock, a provident fund, a bank account, or an insurance plan — and instead of just “numbers,” they enter a command center for that asset.

This is where we go full transparency, full control, and full story.

💼 Portfolio Detail Screen — The “Asset Command Center”
🎯 Mission

Show every detail possible for a single investment/asset.

Make it beautiful and understandable for casuals.

Give deep insight & tools for advanced users.

Maintain fun, alive, storytelling style → not a boring Excel sheet.

🔥 Core Sections of Portfolio Detail

Performance Badge → +12% YoY (color coded: green/red).

Quick Stat Chips:

% Allocation in Portfolio

Holding Period (e.g., 2 years 3 months)

2. Performance Graph (Interactive)

Timeline chart with multiple ranges (1D, 1W, 1M, 1Y, Max).

Overlay benchmarks (e.g., vs. SET Index, vs. S&P 500).

Key events annotated:

“Dividend Paid 💰 – 12 Aug 2024”

“Major dip due to market crash 📉 – Mar 2020”

Hover → tooltips with exact values.

3. Holding Breakdown

Depends on the asset type:

Fund → Units, NAV, Contribution Timeline.

Provident Fund → Employer vs. Employee contribution, vesting %, maturity date.

4. Transaction History (Story View)

Each entry with icon + emoji for quick scanning:

“💸 Bought 100 AAPL @ $150 – Aug 2023”

“💰 Dividend ฿5,000 – Dec 2023”

Optional “classic mode” = clean table for data nerds.

5. Risk & Health Meter

Gauge chart (like a speedometer):

Risk Level: Low / Med / High

Volatility indicator

% Diversification impact (is this asset overweight in portfolio?)

AI note:

“This stock is 40% of your portfolio → high concentration risk ⚠️.”

Makes risk easy to understand visually.

6. Income & Return Summary

Total Gain/Loss (realized + unrealized).

Dividend/Interest Received so far.

Projected Return (based on historical avg or AI model).

Plain-language breakdown:

“You invested ฿500,000. Now worth ฿1,245,000 → total gain ฿745,000 (+149%).”

“Projected to reach ฿2,000,000 in 5 years if trend continues 📈.”

7. Comparison Mode (Optional)

Side-by-side view with:

Other assets in same category (e.g., compare 2 stocks).

Benchmarks (SET Index, market avg).

Toggle → see which asset is pulling weight.

8. Goal Linkage

Show which personal goals this asset supports:

Tesla stock → Retirement 40%, Travel Goal 20%.

Simple icons showing contribution to each goal.

Adds emotional connection: “My house is 25% funded by this stock.”

9. Simulation Sandbox (What If?)

“What if I sell 50% now?” → instantly shows effect on portfolio + goals.

“What if I add ฿10,000/month more into this fund?” → projected graph updates.

Interactive + fun = makes learning intuitive.

10. AI Guide Card (Personal Insight)

One card at the bottom, refreshed daily/weekly:

“This stock grew faster than 80% of your holdings this quarter 🚀.”

“High volatility detected — consider reducing exposure.”

“Dividend incoming next month 💵.”

Tone: coach + cheerleader.

🎨 Visual & UX Style

Big Bold Numbers → never hidden in tiny fonts.

Dual Modes: Playful (visual-rich) / Classic (serious tables).
