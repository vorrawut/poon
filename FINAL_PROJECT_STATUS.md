## 📋 **ESTABLISHED PROJECT RULES**

### **🚨 CRITICAL MOCK DATA RULES (MANDATORY):**

**Rule 1: NO Mock Data in `/src`**
- ✅ ENFORCED: All mock data moved to `/mockData`
- ✅ DOCUMENTED: In both cursor rules and project guide
- ✅ VERIFIED: No mock data remains in `/src`

**Rule 2: Feature-Based Organization**
- ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Mock data organized by features
- ✅ STRUCTURED: Each feature has its own folder
- ✅ CENTRALIZED: Common data in `/mockData/common/`

**Rule 3: Centralized Imports**
- ✅ PATTERN: `import { mockData } from "../../../../mockData/features/[feature]"`
- ✅ CONSISTENCY: All components follow same pattern
- ✅ CLEAN: No local mock data definitions

**Rule 4: Export Structure**
- ✅ ORGANIZED: Each feature has `index.ts` for exports
- ✅ HIERARCHICAL: Main `/mockData/index.ts` exports all
- ✅ MAINTAINABLE: Clean import paths

**Rule 5: Development Workflow**
- ✅ DOCUMENTED: Step-by-step process established
- ✅ ENFORCED: Rules in cursor configuration
- ✅ SCALABLE: Easy to add new features

## 📚 **DOCUMENTATION CREATED**

### **1. `.cursor/rules/react.mdc` ✅**
**Comprehensive React Development Guidelines:**
- Feature-based architecture rules
- Component taxonomy (Atoms → Molecules → Widgets → Features)
- Mock data organization rules
- Import/export patterns
- Testing strategy
